Here’s a **much more detailed yet structured prompt** that still stays **focused and clean**, but adds **creative neumorphic components** without turning the app into a complex system. You can paste this directly into an AI design / code generator.

### **Detailed Prompt: Neumorphic Task Planner Management Website**

> Create a **Task Planner Management Website** with a **modern neumorphism (soft UI) design style** that feels tactile, calm, and intuitive.
>
> ### **Design Language**
>
> * Use a **light neutral background** (soft gray, beige, or pastel tone).
> * Apply **neumorphic shadows** (dual light and dark shadows) to create a soft raised and inset effect.
> * All elements should have **rounded corners**, smooth edges, and subtle depth.
> * Use **minimal color accents** (pastel blue, mint, lavender) only for interactive states.
> * Include **micro-animations** for hover, press, and toggle interactions.
>
> ### **Layout & Structure**
>
> * Centered layout with a **single main container card** floating above the background.
> * Inside the container:
>
>   * A **top header section** with the app name and a short tagline.
>   * A **date indicator** showing today’s date in a soft inset pill.
>   * A **progress indicator** (circular or linear) showing completed tasks.
>
> ### **Task Input Section**
>
> * Neumorphic **inset input field** for entering new tasks.
> * A **soft raised “Add Task” button** with gentle press animation.
> * Optional **priority selector** using small neumorphic pill buttons (Low / Medium / High).
>
> ### **Task List Section**
>
> * Display tasks as **individual neumorphic cards**.
> * Each task card should include:
>
>   * Task title text
>   * Completion toggle (neumorphic switch or checkbox)
>   * Priority indicator using a subtle colored dot
>   * Delete button represented by a soft icon button
> * Completed tasks should appear **slightly inset** with reduced opacity.
>
> ### **Creative Neumorphic Components**
>
> * **Floating action button** with soft glow for quick task creation.
> * **Drag-and-drop interaction** with gentle shadow change while dragging.
> * **Filter pills** (All / Active / Completed) with pressed and raised states.
> * **Soft tooltip** on hover for icons.
>
> ### **User Experience**
>
> * Smooth transitions between states (add, complete, delete).
> * No page reloads; interactions feel instant and fluid.
> * Minimal text, icon-driven controls, and clean spacing.
>
> ### **Constraints**
>
> * Single-page application only.
> * No authentication, analytics, or complex settings.
> * Focus on **task clarity, visual comfort, and neumorphic realism**.
>
> ### **Overall Goal**
>
> Build a visually pleasing, calming task planner that demonstrates **neumorphism done right**—simple, elegant, and functional without unnecessary complexity.
